// Funny disclaimer of how I'm a react developer who uses react everywhere in work, but for my personal project I use astro, and how this is important to the discussion
This post is made by a React developer, who has been using Next.js to develop production ready applications for 2 years, but actually built this blog with Astro because here he can choose whatever tech it's better withou bothering about convincing people (hiring) 


He knew it already has a better DX and perf than React.

I feel like react is already getting dunked on by other solutions which are more performant and have better DX by default (e.g Astro), but is because it it wants to achieve these goals differently. Instead of having direct solutions for it, it will be the base library which will support all the frameworks that on a higher level have opinionated ways to get better perf and DX (nextjs, remix).

This contrasts with other popular frameworks because it's a more long term goal and a very boring one, releasing low level apis gets no hype.

On top of it, I think they can't move as fast as others, because they have to be much more careful for obvious reasons (the leading solution which can shape the future of web has to be extremely robust and that takes time).
By the way this doesn't excuse the incredible delay on releasing docs and other apis :v
The biggest win for react there will be if nextjs can maintain the hype, satisfaction and adoption  This would certainly happen if server components with the new app folder were already working fine, but is far from it. Simple mutations have to be done on a hacky way, which is absurd and just shows how immature is it yet. . This would keep :react: safe on the top because it combines it's popularity with a really great solution for pretty much every use case. 


I think if some company with a big name publish they're using astro things can start to shift. 

Atm what seems to hang react at the top is: popularity - ecosystem - adoption - nextjs. They lost the superiority in DX and perf, but still maintain stuff that's really relevant
+ is important to highlight react is such a mature solution that is probably past the initial hype that others have currently
